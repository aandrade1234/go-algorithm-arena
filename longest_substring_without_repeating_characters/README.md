# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** s = "abcabcbb"<br>
> **Output:** 3<br>
> **Explanation:** The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** s = "bbbbb"<br>
> **Output:** 1<br>
> **Explanation:** The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** s = "pwwkew"<br>
> **Output:** 3<br>
> **Explanation:** The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.<br>
> Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
