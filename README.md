# Go Algorithm Arena

Welcome to the Go Algorithm Arena! This is a space dedicated to solving challenging problems from many platforms using 
Go. It's a place for learning, practicing, and mastering Go language through problem-solving.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by problem categories (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Graphs, etc.). Each category has its own 
folder. Within each folder, you'll find separate Go files for each problem. Each problem includes a link to the original
problem, a brief description, and the solution itself.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse through the folders and files to study the solutions. If you're trying to solve a specific problem,
you can use the search function in GitHub to find if it exists in this repository.

## Contribute

We encourage you to contribute to this project! There are several ways you can contribute:

1. **Improve an existing solution**: If you see a way to optimize the code or make it more readable, feel free to fork 
   the repository, make the changes, and open a pull request.

2. **Add a new solution**: Solved a problem that doesn't exist in the repository? We'd love to include it. Fork the
   repository, add your solution, and open a pull request.

3. **Report a bug**: If you find an error or bug in any of the solutions, please open an issue detailing the bug and 
   where you found it.

4. **Request a solution**: If you're struggling with a problem and would like to see a solution, open an issue as a 
   solution request.

Let's get coding and make this arena filled with robust and efficient Go solutions!
